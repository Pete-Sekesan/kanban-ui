## About The Project

- I have built a todo app before and I looked to that for some guidance. I had wanted to utilize multiple components such as a dedicated Card and List component to tie into the app. Since I had never done anything before with drag and drop, I did some research and tackled it using the react-beautiful-dnd library.
  I did a lot of reading of the docs and a bunch of YouTube videos to get an idea and went to work on it.

## Issues with Backend

- I ran into a multitude of issues installing and getting MongoDB up and running locally on my machine. I found out their docs are a bit outdated in regards to the newer Mac OS systems in that the user/data where the database defaults to is read only. After playing around with that for a couple of hours, I ended up wiping the mongo-community installed as well as a fresh install of Homebrew.
  Ultimately, I could not get the two tied together and opted to focus on a dummy backend to compliment the front. Ideally, for CORS, I would have used the CORS middleware package found in with Express to specify an origin of the localhost:9000 that the backend would have ideally been running on.

## Approach

Again, unfortunately, I could not complete all of the required checkpoints. MongoDB and a drag and drop react application were both entirely new concepts for myself, so I had to spend some time learning both. After it became apparent that I was running out of time, I decided to focus on the one section that I had some control over, which was the front end.

As much as it may not seem like it based on the final product, I did enjoy this assignment. MongoDB and DnD interfaces are both incredibly popular and it was fun, albeit nerve-racking and frustrating at times. But it's all about always learning new things. I plan to take up both of these technologies and hope ti implement something tangible with them in the future. I hope that can also be a future with Pensieve.
